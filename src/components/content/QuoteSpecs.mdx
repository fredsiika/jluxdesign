### Our Story

## Buying stone shouldn't be so hard
## Getting a quote shouldn't be so hard.


Companies in the industry won't give out pricing on one slab of material
We're different

"I can't believe you won't give me a price..."

Reason:
Designer/builder hasn't incorporated all the money
My number is my number for the fabricator, distributor.
We disclose the numbers to you as soon as we come out and
Full disclosure of your quote, we're note shady.
